# Better Retaining Soils

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

This mod enhances retaining soils, making them much more useful!

Do you find the vanilla retaining soil mechanic somewhat underpowered? This mod improves 
its core functionality to make it significantly more valuable! Now, when you water a crop
with a retaining soil, the fertilizer will keep the crop watered for multiple days.

You can customize the duration it retains moisture. By default:
* Basic Retaining Soil maintains moisture for **2 days**
* Quality Retaining Soil maintains moisture for **5 days**

This mod frees you from the repetitive chore of daily watering, especially valuable in 
the early stage of the game! When combined with even a few basic sprinklers, it can water
a large number of crops at minimal time cost. Discover more creative ways to use it!

## Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for most major mods with overlapping functionality, 
such as:

- Visible soil moisture status via UI Info Suite 2 (shows remaining days of moisture)
- Full integration with Ultimate Fertilizer
- ...and other mods you might not expect!
