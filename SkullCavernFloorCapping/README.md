# Skull Cavern Floor Capping

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Add a new rule to prevent the treasure rooms in Skull Cavern level 200 and 300 to be skipped when entering a mine shaft. 

For example, if you jumped in a shaft in Skull Cavern level 199, and this mod will ensure you floored in level 200 instead of skip it.
