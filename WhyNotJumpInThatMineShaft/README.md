# Why Not Jump In That Mine Shaft

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

A simple mod, enhance your mining experience in the mine and skull cavern.

Imagine that you are fighting in the skull cavern, and you find a mine shaft, but you want to dig 
some more valuable minerals, then you forgot the mine shaft and go downstairs via a stair. Do you 
feel annoyed somehow? Well, this mod can help you say goodbye to these circumstances!

This mod adds a confirmation prompt before taking the stairs down when a shaft exists; two 
indicators point at the nearest stair and shaft if available; and a configurable text prompter to 
show specific information. They can significantly improve your mining experience!
