Additional Clause: Restriction on Specific Distribution Platforms

Notwithstanding the broad permissions granted by the MIT License herein, the 
copyright holder imposes the following additional restriction on the Original 
Work and any Derivative Work (as defined below) that incorporates the source 
code of this software mod ("Original Work"):

1. Restriction. You are expressly prohibited from distributing, publishing, 
or otherwise making available any Original and Derivative Work on the website 
known as "玩家动力" (currently accessible at https://www.wanjiadongli.com), or 
any of its subdomains or successor domains, herein referred to as the 
"Restricted Platform".

2. Definition of Derivative Work and Original Work. For the purposes of this 
clause:
 a) "Derivative Work" shall mean any work that is based upon, derived from, 
 or incorporates all or part of the Original Work, in source code or object 
 code form.
 b) "Original Work" shall mean the work in its pristine, unmodified form as 
 published by the copyright holder, including any binaries compiled from the 
 source code in this repository and any official versions released by the 
 copyright holder on its sole and exclusive official distribution platform, 
 namely "Nexus Mods" (currently accessible at https://www.nexusmods.com).

3. Scope. This restriction applies to the distribution of Original Work and 
Derivative Works, and is limited to the aforementioned Restricted Platform. 
Distribution through any other channel, platform, or website remains governed 
solely by the terms of the MIT License. 

4. Written Waiver. The copyright holder may, at their sole discretion, grant 
a written waiver to this restriction for any Original Works or a specific 
Derivative Work. Requests for such a waiver must be directed to 
summerfleur2997@outlook.com.

5. Severability. If any provision of this additional restriction is held to be 
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the 
remaining provisions of the entire license (including the core MIT License) 
shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law.

This additional clause is an integral part of the licensing terms governing 
the use of the Original Work.
