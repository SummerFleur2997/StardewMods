# Better Hats API

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

**Better Hats API** (BHA) is a flexible tool for Stardew Valley mod developers that enables the
creation of hats with custom buff effects, conditional logic, and unique behaviors. Instead of
hardcoding hat effects, BHA allows developers to define properties through JSON configurations
or integrate deeply with C# code.

With BHA, you can easily apply standard stat bonuses (e.g., farming, luck), set conditions based
on game state (season, location, weather), trigger custom actions, and dynamically scale buff
values. The design emphasizes flexibility: simple effects are achievable via JSON alone, while
complex behaviors can be implemented through the C# API.
