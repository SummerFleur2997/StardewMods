individual mods for documentation and release notes.

## Mods
### Active mods:

* **Better Retaining Soils** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/36007) | [source](BetterRetainingSoils))</small>  
  _Enhance and optimize retaining-soil's mechanic to make them able 
  to keep the crop watered for multiple days._
* **Bigger Containers** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/35905) | [source](BiggerContainers))</small>  
  _A small mod helps expand the capacity of your fridges and Junimo 
  chests._
* **Convenient Chests** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/32558) | [source](ConvenientChests))</small>  
  _Makes your life easier: Add a category menu to specify what should
  be contained in this chest, quick stash items to nearby chests,
  crafting and cooking from nearby chests._
* **Skull Cavern Floor Capping** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/37716) | [source](SkullCavernFloorCapping))</small>  
  _Add a new rule to prevent the treasure rooms in Skull Cavern level 
  200 and 300 to be skipped when entering a mine shaft._
* **Why Not Jump In That Mine Shaft** <small>([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/37452) | [source](WhyNotJumpInThatMineShaft))</small>  
  _Useful prompts that can enhance your mining experience in the mine 
  and skull cavern._

### Mods under develop:

* **Custom Sort**  
  _The game's 'organize' feature sorts inventory/chests categorically
  and alphabetically—a common system. For CJK users, however, this
  approach creates friction. So I am trying to find a better solution
  to deliver a smoother experience._
